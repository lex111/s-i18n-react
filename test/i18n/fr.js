/**
* Message translations.
*
* This file is automatically generated by the 'yarn run translations extract'
* command. It contains the localizable messages extracted from source code.
*
* You may modify this file by translating the extracted messages.
*
* Each object element represents the translation (value) of a message (key).
* If the value is empty, the message is considered as not translated.
*
* Messages that no longer need translation will have their translations
* enclosed between a pair of '@@' marks.
*
* Message string can be used with plural forms format. Check the documentation
* for details.
*
* NOTE: this file must be saved in UTF-8 encoding.
