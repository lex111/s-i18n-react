/**
 * Message translations.
 *
 * This file is automatically generated by the 'yarn run translations extract'
 * command. It contains the localizable messages extracted from source code.
 *
 * You may modify this file by translating the extracted messages.
 *
 * Each object element represents the translation (value) of a message (key).
 * If the value is empty, the message is considered as not translated.
 *
 * Messages that no longer need translation will have their translations
 * enclosed between a pair of '@@' marks.
 *
 * Message string can be used with plural forms format. Check the documentation
 * for details.
 *
 * NOTE: this file must be saved in UTF-8 encoding.
